# Maturity Definition: People & Organizational Capability

## Axis Definition

This axis evaluates the maturity of IT department personnel skills, organizational structure, and talent development mechanisms.
It measures the transformation from "person-dependent" to "organizational capability" and the degree of development of bridge personnel who understand both IT and business.

---

## Level 1: Ad-hoc Type

### State
- IT work depends on specific individuals (heroes) with no skill definitions or development policies
- Personnel placement is ad-hoc without planning
- Almost no personnel exchange between IT and business

### Specific Characteristics

**Skill Management:** IT personnel roles and skill requirements not documented; "who can do what" dependent on ad-hoc knowledge; no skill maps or technical inventories

**Development & Evaluation:** No systematic training programs; OJT is ad-hoc, mentoring occurs naturally; evaluation criteria ambiguous and person-dependent

**Personnel Placement:** Work concentrated on specific individuals (single points of failure); difficult handovers during resignation/transfer; career paths unclear

**Organizational Culture:** Insufficient knowledge sharing within IT department; almost no interaction with business departments; sense of isolation as "techies"

**External Dependency:** Over-reliance on external vendors and contractors; no core domain definition, tendency to outsource everything; no awareness of escaping vendor dependency

### Checklist
- [ ] No skill definition documents for IT roles
- [ ] No systematic training programs (no annual training plans)
- [ ] Zero IT⇔Business job rotation track record in past 3 years
- [ ] IT personnel evaluation criteria not documented
- [ ] External dependency ratio (external outsourcing costs/IT budget) 80%+

### Typical Issues
- Business disruption from key person resignation/transfer
- Insufficient understanding of business requirements
- Declining IT personnel motivation
- Recruitment and retention difficulties

---

## Level 2: Basic Infrastructure Type

### State
- Skill requirements defined for major IT roles with training/OJT systems beginning to be developed
- Job rotation piloted
- Evaluation criteria documented and implementation started

### Specific Characteristics

**Skill Management:** Skill definition documents exist for 5-6 major roles (planning/development/operations/security/OT-IT bridge, etc.); skill level definitions (beginner/intermediate/advanced); recommended certifications listed

**Development & Evaluation:** Annual training plans by role developed with execution records; OJT programs partially standardized; IT personnel evaluation criteria documented and operational (including trial phase)

**Personnel Placement:** Job rotation piloted (1-2 people annually, IT⇔manufacturing floor, etc.); multiple persons beginning to be secured for major tasks; career path drafts created

**Organizational Culture:** Quarterly knowledge sharing sessions started; mutual understanding progressing through regular meetings with business departments; improved communication within IT department

**External Dependency:** Beginning to define core domains (architecture, requirements definition, etc.); developing external outsourcing decision criteria (competitive advantage, long-term continuation, market skills); setting insourcing targets (external dependency target 3 years out)

### Checklist
- [ ] Skill definition documents exist for major IT roles (5-6 roles)
- [ ] Annual training plans exist for each role with execution records
- [ ] Minimum 2 job rotations implemented in past year
- [ ] IT personnel evaluation criteria documented and operational
- [ ] External dependency policy documented (core domain definition)

### Typical Issues
- Skill definition becoming formalistic (divergence from reality)
- Insufficient training effectiveness measurement
- Knowledge retention after job rotation
- Slow insourcing progress

## Level 3: Planned Development Type

### State
- Career path and rotation systems formalized and operational
- 30%+ of IT leaders have business department experience, functioning as bridge roles
- IT talent portfolio being developed systematically

### Specific Characteristics

**Skill Management:** Skill definitions complete for all IT roles, reviewed annually; regular skill assessments (1-2 times annually); individual skill development plans developed

**Development & Evaluation:** Comprehensive role-based training programs (combination of internal/external/e-learning); mentoring system formalized (experienced staff supporting juniors); evaluation criteria matured and clearly linked to promotions/advancement

**Personnel Placement:** Job rotation system formalized (period, targets, evaluation methods clear); 5+ people annually participating in rotation; rotation alumni serving as mentors; knowledge base (wiki, case studies, etc.) established and utilized

**Organizational Culture:** IT/business bridge personnel recognized and active within organization; "IT" and "business" walls lowering; team performance quantitative monitoring started (project success rate, deadline compliance rate, etc.)

**External Dependency:** Core domains principally insourced, external used for capability supplementation/acceleration; external dependency systematically reduced (e.g., 80% → 60%); healthy cooperative relationships with vendors (co-creation not outsourcing)

### Checklist
- [ ] Career path and rotation systems formalized and operational
- [ ] 30%+ of IT leaders have business department experience (or vice versa)
- [ ] Rotation alumni knowledge base established and utilized
- [ ] IT talent portfolio (architects, BAs, OT-IT bridge, etc.) systematically developed
- [ ] Team performance quantitative monitoring initiated

### Typical Issues
- Post-rotation treatment (return to original dept vs settle in new dept)
- Appropriate evaluation and compensation for bridge personnel
- Balance between development investment and short-term results
- Retaining top talent

---

## Level 4: Optimized Type

### State
- Team performance quantitatively monitored with improvement PDCA running
- Talent portfolio strategically managed with proactive development of skills needed for future business plans
- Knowledge sharing established as culture with organizational learning functioning

### Specific Characteristics

**Skill Management:** Quantitative skill gap analysis (current vs 3-year target); data-based personnel placement optimization; comparison with market value of skills

**Development & Evaluation:** Development investment ROI measurement (training costs vs productivity improvement); individual performance-skill correlation analysis; high-performer characteristic analysis reflected in development

**Personnel Placement:** Rotation effectiveness measurement (quantitative evaluation of bridge function); data-based optimal placement; succession planning established

**Organizational Culture:** Knowledge sharing incorporated into evaluation metrics; learning from failure established as culture; high psychological safety organization

**External Dependency:** Strategic collaboration with externals (insource core, outsource non-core clearly defined); equal partnership relationships with vendors; skill transfer through collaboration with external talent

### Checklist
- [ ] Team performance indicators (project success rate, quality, deadlines, etc.) measured quarterly and improved
- [ ] Talent portfolio systematically developed based on 3-year business plan
- [ ] Knowledge sharing incorporated into evaluation metrics and utilized

## Key Actions Required for Level Transitions

**1→2:** Define major role skills, develop annual training plans, pilot job rotation

**2→3:** Formalize rotation system, build knowledge base, start systematic IT talent portfolio development

**3→4:** Quantitative team performance monitoring, quantitative personnel placement optimization, measure development investment ROI

**4→5:** Proactive investment development for new technologies, encourage external dissemination, build open innovation framework

---

## Evaluation Considerations

1. **Check Gap Between System and Reality:** Verify not just system existence but actual operation; insufficient if rotation system exists but only 1 person annually

2. **Balance Quantitative and Qualitative:** Important not just numbers but personnel satisfaction and motivation; meaningless if training implementation rate is 100% but content is formalistic

3. **Long-term Perspective Verification:** Talent development doesn't yield short-term results; evaluate planning with 3-5 year perspective

4. **Business-side Evaluation:** How IT personnel are evaluated by business departments; whether "IT personnel are reliable" perception exists
