# Maturity Definition: IT Governance & Security

## Axis Definition

This axis evaluates the maturity of IT governance including IT investment decision-making processes, risk management, security, and change management.
It measures the transformation from "ad-hoc, person-dependent management" to "systematic, quantitative governance."

---

## Level 1: Unestablished Type (Initial)

### State
IT governance processes almost nonexistent or extremely ad-hoc and person-dependent

### Specific Characteristics
**Investment Management:** Unclear IT investment decision criteria, no project evaluation process  
**Change Management:** Changes unplanned and unrecorded, no impact assessment  
**Risk Management:** No IT risk assessment, no risk register  
**Security:** Security policies undeveloped or formalistic, ad-hoc incident response  
**Vendor Management:** No SLAs, ad-hoc vendor evaluation

### Checklist
- [ ] IT investment evaluation process not documented
- [ ] Change management process doesn't exist
- [ ] No IT risk assessment in past 3 years
- [ ] No security incident response procedures
- [ ] Major vendor SLAs not established

---

## Level 2: Basic Infrastructure Type (Managed)

### State
Basic processes documented and executed 1+ times annually

### Specific Characteristics
**Investment Management:** IT investment evaluation process exists, operational at project initiation  
**Change Management:** Change management process documented, executed 1+ times annually  
**Risk Management:** IT+OT risks registered in common register, annual evaluation  
**Security:** Security policies updated considering OT environment, incident response procedures exist  
**Vendor Management:** SLAs established for major vendors (5-10), annual evaluation

### Checklist
- [ ] Change management process documented and executed 1+ times annually
- [ ] IT investment evaluation process exists, operational at project initiation
- [ ] Risk management process (IT+OT) documented with annual evaluation
- [ ] Security policies updated considering OT environment
- [ ] Major vendor SLAs established with regular reviews

---

## Level 3: Defined & Established Type

### State
Processes organizationally established, regularly executed and improved

### Specific Characteristics
**Investment Management:** Portfolio management introduced, annual ROI/KPI achievement evaluation  
**Change Management:** Change impact assessment standardized, clear approval flows  
**Risk Management:** Quarterly risk assessment, countermeasure progress monitoring  
**Security:** Annual security audits, vulnerability management process established  
**Vendor Management:** Strategic vendor relationships, co-creation projects exist

### Checklist
- [ ] IT investment portfolio evaluated annually with ROI/KPIs
- [ ] Change management standardized with measured approval/success rates
- [ ] Quarterly risk assessment with countermeasure monitoring
- [ ] Security audits conducted 1+ times annually
- [ ] Co-creation projects with strategic vendors

---

## Level 4: Quantitatively Managed Type

### State
Processes quantitatively managed and continuously improved

### Specific Characteristics
**Investment Management:** Quarterly portfolio monitoring, low-performance projects cancelled/modified  
**Change Management:** Change success rates statistically analyzed, predictive models used  
**Risk Management:** Risks quantitatively evaluated, used in investment decisions  
**Security:** Security metrics (detection time, recovery time, etc.) continuously improved  
**Vendor Management:** Vendor performance quantitatively evaluated, used in contract renewal decisions

### Checklist
- [ ] IT investment portfolio monitored quarterly, low-performance projects cancelled/modified
- [ ] Change success rates statistically managed
- [ ] Risks quantitatively evaluated and used in investment decisions
- [ ] Security metrics continuously improved

---

## Level 5: Optimizing Type

### State
Processes continuously optimized, driving innovation

### Specific Characteristics
**Investment Management:** Investment decisions using predictive models/AI  
**Change Management:** Automated change management, DevOps/DevSecOps  
**Risk Management:** Risk-based executive decisions, board reporting  
**Security:** AI-based threat detection, zero trust implementation  
**Vendor Management:** Ecosystem-type collaboration, open innovation

### Checklist
- [ ] AI-based investment decisions and risk prediction
- [ ] Change management automated (CI/CD, etc.)
- [ ] IT risks regularly reported to board
- [ ] Zero trust architecture implemented

---

## Key Actions Required for Level Transitions

**1→2:** Document processes, execute annually  
**2→3:** Establish processes, regular reviews, improvement PDCA  
**3→4:** Quantitative monitoring, statistical analysis  
**4→5:** Automation, AI utilization, continuous optimization

---

## Evaluation Considerations

- Verify not just process existence but execution records
- Check if leading to improvements, not just formalistic execution
- Listen to evaluations from not only IT department but also audit department and executives
