# Maturity Definition: Business Alignment & Value Creation

## Axis Definition

This axis evaluates the degree to which the IT department collaborates with business departments and co-creates business value.
It measures the transformation from "reactive IT" to "IT that proposes and co-creates business value."

---

## Level 1: Ad-hoc Response Type

### State
- IT department builds and operates systems individually in response to requests from business departments
- Almost no proactive proposals from IT side
- Link between business strategy and IT initiatives is ad-hoc and fragmented

### Specific Characteristics

**Strategic Alignment:**
- Unclear relationship between mid-term management plans and IT
- IT department not involved in business strategy formulation
- IT investment priorities determined by "loudest voice" or "urgency"

**Project Management:**
- Individual response per project, no company-wide coordination
- Majority of projects lack documented business objectives or KPIs
- ROI evaluation is retrospective and ad-hoc

**Communication:**
- No regular dialogue forum with business departments

- Consulted only after issues become apparent (no preventive involvement)

### Checklist
- [ ] 80%+ of IT investment projects do not specify business KPIs
- [ ] No regular meetings between IT and business departments
- [ ] IT strategy or mid-term IT roadmap doesn't exist or is merely formal
- [ ] IT investment effectiveness verification not systematically conducted

### Typical Issues
- Duplication and inefficiency in IT investments

## Evaluation Considerations

1. **Evidence Verification**
   - Verify not just "doing it" claims but execution records and deliverables
   - Example: Roadmap documents, meeting minutes, KPI achievement rate data

2. **Consistency Check**
   - Implemented company-wide and continuously, not just in some departments/projects
   - Example: Regular meetings held across all major departments, not just specific ones

3. **Effectiveness Verification**
   - Actually functioning, not just formally existing
   - Example: Roadmap not just developed but actually used in investment decisions

4. **Business-side Evaluation**
   - Listen to business department evaluations, not just IT department self-assessment
   - Example: Whether business departments perceive "IT as co-creation partner"
