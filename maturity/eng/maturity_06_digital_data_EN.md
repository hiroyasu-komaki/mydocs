# Maturity Definition: Digitalization & Data Platform

## Axis Definition

This axis evaluates the development status of core systems, data platforms, and digital tools, and the realization of data-driven management.
It measures the transformation from "proliferation of individual systems" to "integrated digital platform."

## Level 1: Fragmented System Type

### State
Systems exist separately with isolated and siloed data

### Specific Characteristics
**System Configuration:** Core systems (ERP, MES, SFA, etc.) individually deployed by department, weak integration  
**Data Management:** Data scattered across systems, inconsistent master data  
**Analysis & Utilization:** Data analysis ad-hoc and person-dependent, Excel-centric  
**Tools:** Digital tools (BI, RPA, etc.) almost not deployed  
**Data Governance:** Data quality management and security policies undeveloped

### Checklist
- [ ] Data integration between core systems manual/batch-centric
- [ ] Master data (customers, products, suppliers, etc.) differs by department
- [ ] No data analysis platform (DWH, data lake, etc.)
- [ ] BI tools almost not deployed, Excel-based analysis predominant
- [ ] Data governance policies undeveloped

---

## Level 2: Infrastructure Integration Type

### State
Major systems integrated with partially automated data integration

### Specific Characteristics
**System Configuration:** Major systems (ERP-MES-SFA, etc.) integrated via APIs  
**Data Management:** Master data unification initiated, data lake or DWH deployment considered  
**Analysis & Utilization:** BI tools deployed, standard reports automated  
**Tools:** Digital tools like RPA and workflow pilot-deployed  
**Data Governance:** Data quality standards and security policy drafts created

### Checklist
- [ ] Data integration between major systems automated via APIs
- [ ] Master data unification project ongoing or completed
- [ ] BI tools deployed with automated standard reports
- [ ] RPA or workflow tools operational in some operations
- [ ] Data quality standards documented

---

## Level 3: Data Utilization Type (Data-driven)

### State
Data platform integrated with cross-departmental data-driven decision-making initiated

### Specific Characteristics
**System Configuration:** End-to-end system integration, real-time data integration  
**Data Management:** Data lake/DWH operational, Master Data Management (MDM) running  
**Analysis & Utilization:** Self-service BI widespread, data scientists deployed, predictive analytics started  
**Tools:** RPA, AI/ML, IoT tools operational across multiple operations  
**Data Governance:** Data owner system, data catalog established, quality monitoring

### Checklist
- [ ] Data lake/DWH operational with cross-departmental data utilization
- [ ] Master Data Management (MDM) operational with monitored data quality
- [ ] Self-service BI widespread with autonomous business department data analysis
- [ ] Predictive analytics (demand forecasting, failure prediction, etc.) practical in some operations
- [ ] Data catalog established with clear data location and definitions

---

## Level 4: Optimized Type

### State
Data platform advanced with AI/ML-driven automation and optimization progressing

### Specific Characteristics
**System Configuration:** Cloud-native, microservices, API economy  
**Data Management:** Data mesh or data fabric, real-time data pipelines  
**Analysis & Utilization:** AI/ML models operational across multiple operations, automated decision-making  
**Tools:** No-code/low-code widespread, citizen developers active  
**Data Governance:** Data lineage tracking, automated quality management

### Checklist
- [ ] AI/ML models operational across multiple operations (demand forecasting, quality prediction, etc.)
- [ ] Data pipelines real-time or near-real-time
- [ ] Citizen developers active with no-code/low-code tools
- [ ] Data lineage automatically tracked enabling impact analysis

---

## Level 5: Innovation Type (Innovating)

### State
Data and AI as sources of new business models, continuously creating innovation

### Specific Characteristics
**System Configuration:** Platform-type architecture, ecosystem integration  
**Data Management:** Data productization, internal/external data distribution and monetization  
**Analysis & Utilization:** AutoML, generative AI utilization, continuous learning models  
**Tools:** AI First organization, all employees utilizing data and AI  
**Data Governance:** Data ethics, AI governance established

### Checklist
- [ ] New services/business models utilizing data exist
- [ ] Data monetization (sales/provision) implemented or considered
- [ ] Generative AI utilized in operations
- [ ] AI ethics and governance policies established

---

## Key Actions Required for Level Transitions

**1→2:** System integration, master data unification, BI tool deployment  
**2→3:** Data lake/DWH construction, MDM operation, start predictive analytics  
**3→4:** AI/ML practical use, real-time pipelines, promote citizen development  
**4→5:** Data productization, new business model creation, establish AI governance

## Evaluation Considerations

- Verify not just system deployment but actual data utilization
- Check not just "BI tools exist" but "who uses them and how much"
- Verify data quality reality (not just policies but actual quality)
- Check if "AI utilization" is experimental or creating value in actual operations
