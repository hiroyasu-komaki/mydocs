## Key Actions Required for Level Transitions

**1→2:** Establish SLAs, start vendor evaluation, establish regular meetings  
**2→3:** Select strategic partners, share mid-term roadmap, start joint PoCs  
**3→4:** Build ecosystem, university/startup partnerships, multi-company co-creation  
**4→5:** Participate in consortia, co-create new businesses, open innovation

## Evaluation Considerations

- Verify "strategic partners" not just nominal but substantial collaboration
- Verify co-creation results (PoC outcomes, business value, etc.)
- Listen to vendor-side evaluations (healthy relationships?)
- Verify company maintains initiative, not excessive vendor dependency
